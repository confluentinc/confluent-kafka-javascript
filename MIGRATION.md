# Migration Guide

## KafkaJS


1. Change the import statement, and add a `kafkaJS` block around your configs.
    ```javascript
    const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');
    const kafka = new Kafka({ brokers: ['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092'], /* ... */ });
    const producer = kafka.producer({ /* ... */, });
    ```
    to
    ```javascript
    const { Kafka } = require('@confluentinc/kafka-javascript').KafkaJS;
    const kafka = new Kafka({ kafkaJS: { brokers: ['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092'], /* ... */ } });
    const producer = kafka.producer({ kafkaJS: { /* ... */, } });
    ```

2. Try running your program. In case a migration is needed, an informative error will be thrown.

3. The most common expected changes to the code are:
  - For the **producer**: `acks`, `compression` and `timeout` are not set on a per-send() basis.
    Rather, they must be configured in the top-level configuration while creating the producer.
  - For the **consumer**:
    - `fromBeginning` is not set on a per-subscribe() basis.
      Rather, it must be configured in the top-level configuration while creating the consumer.
    - `autoCommit` and `autoCommitInterval` are not set on a per-run() basis.
      Rather, they must be configured in the top-level configuration while creating the consumer.
    - `autoCommitThreshold` is not supported and `eachBatch` batch size never exceeds 1.
  - For errors: Check the `error.code` rather than the error `name` or `type`.

4. A more exhaustive list of semantic and configuration differences is [presented below](#common).

5. An example migration:

```diff
-const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');
+const { Kafka } = require('@confluentinc/kafka-javascript').KafkaJS;

const kafka = new Kafka({
+ kafkaJS: {
  clientId: 'my-app',
  brokers: ['kafka1:9092', 'kafka2:9092']
+ }
})

const producerRun = async () => {
- const producer = kafka.producer();
+ const producer = kafka.producer({ kafkaJS: { acks: 1 } });
  await producer.connect();
  await producer.send({
    topic: 'test-topic',
-   acks: 1,
    messages: [
      { value: 'Hello confluent-kafka-javascript user!' },
    ],
  });
};


const consumerRun = async () => {
  // Consuming
- const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'test-group' });
+ const consumer = kafka.consumer({ kafkaJS: { groupId: 'test-group', fromBeginning: true } });
  await consumer.connect();
- await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'test-topic', fromBeginning: true });
+ await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'test-topic' });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ topic, partition, message }) => {
      console.log({
        partition,
        offset: message.offset,
        value: message.value.toString(),
      })
    },
  });
};

producerRun().then(consumerRun).catch(console.error);
```

  ```javascript
  const producer = kafka.producer({ kafkaJS: { /* producer-specific configuration changes. */ } });
  ```

  Each allowed config property is discussed in the table below.
  If there is any change in semantics or the default values, the property and the change is **highlighted in bold**.

  | Property                | Default Value                                              | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

#### Semantic and Per-Method Changes

* `send`: and `sendBatch`:`
  - While sending multiple messages, even if one of the messages fails, the method throws an error.
  - While `sendBatch` is available, it acts as a wrapper around send, and the actual batching is handled by librdkafka.
  - `acks`, `compression` and `timeout` are not set on a per-send basis. Rather, they must be configured in the top-level configuration. See [configuration changes](#producer-configuration-changes).
    Additionally, there are several more compression types available by default besides GZIP.
    Before:
    ```javascript
    const kafka = new Kafka({/* ... */});
    const producer = kafka.producer();
    await producer.connect();

    await producer.send({
      topic: 'test',
      messages: [ /* ... */ ],
      acks: 1,
      compression: CompressionTypes.GZIP,
      timeout: 30000,
    });
    ```

    After:
    ```javascript
    const kafka = new Kafka({ kafkaJS: { /* ... */ }});
    const producer = kafka.producer({
      kafkaJS: {
        acks: 1,
        compression: CompressionTypes.GZIP|CompressionTypes.SNAPPY|CompressionTypes.LZ4|CompressionTypes.ZSTD|CompressionTypes.NONE,
        timeout: 30000,
      }
    });
    await producer.connect();

    await producer.send({
      topic: 'test',
      messages: [ /* ... */ ],
    });
    ```

* A transactional producer (with a `transactionId`) set, **cannot** send messages without initiating a transaction using `producer.transaction()`.

### Consumer

#### Consumer Configuration Changes

  ```javascript
  const consumer = kafka.consumer({ kafkaJS: { /* producer-specific configuration changes. */ } });
  ```
  Each allowed config property is discussed in the table below.
  If there is any change in semantics or the default values, the property and the change is **highlighted in bold**.

  | Property                 | Default Value                     | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

  | **maxBytesPerPartition** | 1048576 (1MB)                     | determines how many bytes can be fetched in one request from a single partition. There is a change in semantics, this size grows dynamically if a single message larger than this is encountered, and the client does not get stuck. |

#### Semantic and Per-Method Changes


* `subscribe`:
  - Regex flags are ignored while passing a topic subscription (like 'i' or 'g').
  - Subscribe must be called only after `connect`.
  - An optional parameter, `replace` is provided.
    If set to true, the current subscription is replaced with the new one. If set to false, the new subscription is added to the current one, for example,
    `consumer.subscribe({ topics: ['topic1'], replace: true});`.
    The default value is false to retain existing behaviour.
  - While passing a list of topics to `subscribe`, the `fromBeginning` is not set on a per-subscribe basis. Rather, it must be configured in the top-level configuration.

    Before:
      ```javascript
        const consumer = kafka.consumer({
          groupId: 'test-group',
        });
        await consumer.connect();
        await consumer.subscribe({ topics: ["topic"], fromBeginning: true});
      ```
    After:
      ```javascript
        const consumer = kafka.consumer({
          kafkaJS: {
            groupId: 'test-group',
            fromBeginning: true,
          }
        });
        await consumer.connect();
        await consumer.subscribe({ topics: ["topic"] });
      ```

* `run` :
  - For auto-committing using a consumer, the properties `autoCommit` and `autoCommitInterval` on `run` are not set on a per-subscribe basis.
    Rather, they must be configured in the top-level configuration.
    `autoCommitThreshold` is not supported.
    If `autoCommit` is set to true, messages are *not* committed per-message, but rather periodically at the interval specified by `autoCommitInterval` (default 5 seconds).

    Before:
    ```javascript
      const kafka = new Kafka({ /* ... */ });
      const consumer = kafka.consumer({ /* ... */ });
      await consumer.connect();
      await consumer.subscribe({ topics: ["topic"] });
      consumer.run({
        eachMessage: someFunc,
        autoCommit: true,
        autoCommitInterval: 5000,
      });
    ```
    After:
    ```javascript
      const kafka = new Kafka({ kafkaJS: { /* ... */ } });
      const consumer = kafka.consumer({
        kafkaJS: {
          /* ... */,
          autoCommit: true,
          autoCommitInterval: 5000,
        },
      });
      await consumer.connect();
      await consumer.subscribe({ topics: ["topic"] });
      consumer.run({
        eachMessage: someFunc,
      });
    ```
  - The `heartbeat()` no longer needs to be called by the user in the `eachMessage callback`. Heartbeats are automatically managed by librdkafka.
  - The `partitionsConsumedConcurrently` property is not supported at the moment.
  - An API compatible version of `eachBatch` is available, but the batch size never exceeds 1. The property `eachBatchAutoResolve` is supported.
* `commitOffsets`:
  - Does not yet support sending metadata for topic partitions being committed.
* `seek`:
  - The restriction to call seek only after `run` is removed. It can be called any time.
* `pause` and `resume`:
  - These methods MUST be called after the consumer group is joined.
    In practice, this means it can be called whenever `consumer.assignment()` has a non-zero size, or within the `eachMessage`
    callback.
* `stop` is not yet supported, and the user must disconnect the consumer.

### Admin Client

  * The admin-client is currently experimental, and only has support for a limited subset of methods. The API is subject to change.
    The methods supported are:
    * The `createTopics` method does not yet support the `validateOnly` or `waitForLeaders` properties, and the per-topic configuration
      does not support `replicaAssignment`.
    * The `deleteTopics` method is fully supported.

### Using the Schema Registry

In case you are using the Schema Registry client at `kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry`, you will not need to make any changes to the usage.
An example is made available [here](../examples/kafkajs/sr.js).

### Error Handling

  **Action**: Convert any checks based on `instanceof` and `error.name` or to error
            checks based on `error.code` or `error.type`.

  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  try {
    await producer.send(/* args */);
  } catch (error) {
    if (!Kafka.isKafkaJSError(error)) { /* unrelated err handling */ }
    else if (error.fatal) { /* fatal error, abandon producer */ }
    else if (error.code === Kafka.ErrorCode.ERR__QUEUE_FULL) { /*...*/ }
    else if (error.type === 'ERR_MSG_SIZE_TOO_LARGE') { /*...*/ }
    /* and so on for specific errors */
  }
  ```

  **Comprehensive Changes**:

   Some possible subtypes of `KafkaJSError` have been removed,
   and additional information has been added into `KafkaJSError`.
   Fields have been added denoting if the error is fatal, retriable, or abortable (the latter two only relevant for a transactional producer).
   Some error-specific fields have also been removed.

   An exhaustive list of changes is at the bottom of this section.

   For compatibility, as many error types as possible have been retained, but it is
   better to switch to checking the `error.code`.


   Exhaustive list of error types and error fields removed:
   | Error                                     | Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   |-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `KafkaJSNonRetriableError`                | Removed. Retriable errors are automatically retried by librdkafka, so there's no need for this type. Note that `error.retriable` still exists, but it's applicable only for transactional producer, where users are expected to retry an action themselves. All error types using this as a superclass now use `KafkaJSError` as their superclass. |
   | `KafkaJSOffsetOutOfRange`                 | `topic` and `partition` are removed from this object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
   | `KafkaJSMemberIdRequired`                 | Removed. Automatically handled by librdkafka.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   | `KafkaJSNumberOfRetriesExceeded`          | Removed. Retries are handled by librdkafka.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | `KafkaJSNumberOfRetriesExceeded`          | `broker, correlationId, createdAt, sentAt` and `pendingDuration` are removed from this object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | `KafkaJSMetadataNotLoaded`                | Removed. Metadata is automatically reloaded by librdkafka.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## node-rdkafka

Change the import statement, from
  ```javascript
  const Kafka = require('node-rdkafka');
  ```
  to
  ```javascript
  const Kafka = require('@confluentinc/kafka-javascript');
  ```
The rest of the functionality should work as usual.
